# Normal_Posteriors
In this repository some hacks and tips are presented for easily generating a posterior distribution when likelihood and prior follow a normal distribution. We discuss how we can easily identify the precision matrix, Q where for the $\mu$ we need to take first the product Q\mu. 
In addition, we present the idea of integrating out parameters from a probability density function.
